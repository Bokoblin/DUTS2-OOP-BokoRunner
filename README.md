# README : Project Runner #


### Description ###


This repository is being used for the programming project of our "University Technology Diploma" second semester in 
Computer Science. This project consists in creating a "runner" game (an auto-scrolling platform game) where the player 
has to dodge each obstacles and collect bonuses to increase its score. The game ends when the player's life bar is empty.
The project allowed us to put into practice the Object Oriented Programming notions that we learnt in S2.
