### What is this repository for? ###


This repository is used for the programming project of our "University Technology Diploma" in Computer Science second semester. 
This project consists in creating a "runner" game ( an auto-scrolling platform game) where the player, a ball, has to avoid each obstacles
and collect bonuses to increase its score. The game ends when the player's life bar is empty.
The project allows us to put into practice the Object Oriented Programming notions that we are learning in S2.
